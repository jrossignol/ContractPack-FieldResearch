        homeDesc = Due to the number of Kerbals that believe the crazy notion that rocketry has an adverse effect on @targetBody's climate, we've been asked by the government to perform a climate study.  Let's prove once and for all that rocketry is completely safe (ecologically speaking, that is).
        otherDesc = There are a remarkable number of similarities between HomeWorld() and @targetBody, so much so that scientists say that HomeWorld() may have once looked like @targetBody.  Or maybe they said that HomeWorld() will look like @targetBody in a few hundred years, I can't remember.  We've been asked by the government to perform a climate study.  Make sure that the experiments don't imply that pollutants affect the climate on HomeWorld().
