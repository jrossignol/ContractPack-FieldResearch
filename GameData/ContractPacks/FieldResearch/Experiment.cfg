    description = Wernher is especially excited to try some @experiment.Name().ToLower() experiments at various locations on @targetBody.  We doubt the results will be much different from the last study Wernher commissioned...  but he's the boss!
    synopsis = Run the @experiment.Name().ToLower() experiments on @targetBody.
    completedMessage = Yup, that's definitely a lot of @experiment.Name().ToLower() results.  Just put the data in a spreadsheet and we'll look at it later.
