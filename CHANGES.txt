ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.6
- Prevent scientist contract from completing out of order (thanks kcs123).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.5
- Fixed various issues with the scientist contracts (thanks smjjames).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.4
- Fixed contracts without any parameters (thanks smjjames).
- Fixed near-duplicate geological and climate contracts (thanks smjjames).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.3
- Strategia integration.
- SCANsat support - bodies need a biome scan before Field Research contracts are offered (thanks severedsolo).
- Rewrote some contracts using the ITERATOR functionality to reduce complexity.
- Improvements to Scientist contracts.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.2
- No longer offer Station Science contracts that are near-impossible to achieve (thanks Mermel).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.1
- Fixed issue with scientist contract under New Horizons (thanks zeropositivo).
- Fixed issue with scraps contract (thanks Nori).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.1.0
- Support for New Horizons.
- Make Hard Science waypoints more clear that they are only a suggestion.
- Increased rewards for KSC science contracts.
- Improvements to progression - many contracts now show up earlier.
- Reduced difficult of experiment contracts (reduced the amount of biome-hopping required).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.6
- Bump rewards up a little bit.
- Change Scientist contract to require that the player orbits Mun or Minmus before it is offered.
- Renamed scaled agent icon to .truecolor to prevent erroneous DDS conversions.
- Fixed issue with asteroid science being requested for HardScience contract.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.5
- Minor fixes for RSS.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.4
- Various performance improvements for contract generation.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.3
- Better checking for available experiments in experiment and KSC contracts (makes them fail generation less frequently).
- Improvements to logic in scientist contract.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.2
- Fixed so asteroid sample experiments no longer show up (thanks tomf).  They may be added as their own contract in future.
- Limited biomes for KSC contract.

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.1
- Fixed typo (thanks Barking Sands).
- Fixed issue with Rare Science contract generating for bodies the player hasn't visited yet (thanks True-Chaos).

ContractPack-FieldResearch 1.0.0
- Initial release.
